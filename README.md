Production AI Control Infrastructure

I design and operate production AI control layers for high-risk operational workflows.

My work focuses on systems that know when not to answer — enforcing confidence gating, escalation boundaries, and controlled automation in live environments.

The full production infrastructure is private and delivered as a managed service.
